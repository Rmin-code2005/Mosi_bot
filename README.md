# ðŸ¤– Customer Greeting Robot Using Arduino Nano
## ðŸ“˜ Overview
In this tutorial, you will build a Customer Greeting Robot that welcomes visitors using an LED matrix display, audio playback, and distance sensing. This robot uses the following components:

Arduino Nano (main controller)

DFPlayer Mini (plays MP3 audio files)

LED Matrix (displays welcome messages)

SRF05 Ultrasonic Sensor (detects nearby people)

Voltage Buck Converter (powers the circuit safely)

When a customer approaches, the ultrasonic sensor detects them. Then, the robot plays a greeting audio .
